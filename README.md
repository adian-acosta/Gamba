# Gamba

A plugin for the game Final Fantasy 14 that lets players who are casino dealers have a easy way to manage their players bet amounts
and be able to quickly get the players payout at the end of each round to make the trading process faster and keeping the gambling going fast and smooth.

Point of it is that I know some dealers would have a notebook and calculator on hand to manage their bets and keep track of it all. This is just a way to 
have a quick easy info to keep track of in game.

## Installation & How to use

* The plugin can be found by searching in game within the Dalamud plugins, if you don't have Dalamud follow these steps. First download the [XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/)
from Dalamud and follow the installation steps, launch the game using the XIVLauncher, once in game press ESC to go into system popup and click "Dalamud Plugins". Select the All plugins tab
and in the search bar on the top right search for "Gamba". Click the plugin and select the install button and the plugin will be installed and ready to go.
* To use the plugin, within your chat window type in "/gamba" and a window will pop up. Target the player(s) you would like to add and click the "Add Player" button. Their name will pop up in the window
along with an bet you can input, inside the bet box input how much they are willing to bet and the payout section below will update to what was put in. Generally it is double the bet, but on top of the window
if the "Blackjack" box is checked a new button will appear along each player called "Has Blackjack" this button will instead multiply the provided bet by the the given factor and show the results 
in the payout.
* Once the round has ended you can click the "Copy Payout to Clipboard" option and be able to paste this into the trade window for each player.
